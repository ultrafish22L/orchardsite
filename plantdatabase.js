        general_info: "Red Finger Lime is an Australian native citrus with unique caviar-like vesicles inside cylindrical fruit. Originally called 'gulalung' by the Bundjalung people, this hardy understory shrub can reach 25 feet in natural habitat. The plant features straight thorns at nodes, small narrow leaves with slight orange aroma, and white to pink flowers. Fruit are cylindrical with dark green to crimson peels containing translucent, nearly free spherical vesicles that burst with tangy flavor when chewed. The 'citrus pearls' are highly valued by chefs for garnishing and special culinary applications. Takes about 5 months from flowering to fruit maturity in Hawaii.",
        cultivation_tips: "Finger limes thrive in full sun with well-drained acidic soils (pH 5-6.5). Plant 8-10 feet apart with 12-15 feet between rows, or up to 600-800 trees per acre in Hawaii. Requires windbreak protection as plants are easily damaged. Use drip irrigation to maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilize with 8-8-8 Complehumus quarterly or low-numbered citrus fertilizer. Grafted trees fruit in 3 years versus 15 years for seedlings. In Australia, avoid fertilizing from flowering until fruit reaches 1 inch. High nitrogen reduces flowering. Harvest fruit based on size and color - they do not ripen off the tree.",
        pest_management: "Generally tolerant to Huanglongbing (citrus greening disease) compared to other citrus. Main diseases include Phytophthora root rot (use Citrus trifoliata rootstock for protection) and citrus melanose causing fruit rind blemishes during humid weather. Monitor for scale insects, aphids, whitefly, citrus leaf miner causing leaf curl, and broad mite. Beneficial insects help control many pests naturally. Twig dieback can occur from frost, hot winds, or soil moisture stress.",
        pruning_guidelines: "Create open-shaped tree with 4-6 main branches, keeping final height under 10 feet for easier harvesting due to thorns. Begin pruning before flowering starts. Some growers maintain 1/8 wedge cut out for easier center access. Light pruning and dead branch removal are common. Open shape prevents fruit rubbing and marring while improving air circulation. Regular pruning essential for hedge-row systems with closer spacing."
